# Contemporaries

See who lived alongside your favorite historical figures!

This website allows you to search for any historical figure and see who lived alongside them. It uses a large dataset of historical figures and their birth and death dates to find contemporaries. The website is built using SolidJS and the TimelineJS library.

## Acknowledgements

The data used by this project came from [Morgane Laouenan et al. &#8599;](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01369-4). The data was sorted based on a person's notability ranking. Only the top 250,000 historical figures are viewable.

The timeline visualization was created using [Timeline by Knightlab &#8599;](https://timeline.knightlab.com/).

Original data was provided by [Wikipedia &#8599;](https://www.wikipedia.org/) and [Wikidata &#8599;](https://www.wikidata.org/).
